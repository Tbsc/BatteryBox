# BatteryBox
Medium-Sized Energy Storage Mod

All this mod adds is, as said above, are 4 tiers of "Battery Boxes".
These are blocks that can hold energy (RF in particular), and each tier has its own capacity and max transfer speeds like Energy Cells.

As it uses the RF API, CoFHCore is required, and won't work without it ([CoFHCore on CurseForge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cofhcore)).
Also, this mod adds no way to generate/transfer RF, so you will also need another mod that does that.

Examples are: 
- Thermal Expansion
 * [CurseForge Project](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/thermalexpansion)
 * [TeamCoFH's Website](http://teamcofh.com/downloads/)
- Ender IO
 * [CurseForge Project](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/enderio)
 * [Ender IO's Website](http://enderio.com)
- Immersive Enginnering

I did my research, eh?
